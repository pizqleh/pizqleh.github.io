## About

I am a PhD Student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Mateo Díaz](https://mateodd25.github.io/). Before that, I completed an MSc in Electrical Engineering and a Bachelor's in Mathematical and Computational Engineering, where I was advised by [Carlos Sing Long](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/en/people/faculty/186-carlos-a-sing-long).
