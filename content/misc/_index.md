Music has been a big part of my life ever since I started playing classical piano at six years old. These days, I am grateful to be mentored by [Dr. Shirley Yoo](https://peabody.jhu.edu/faculty/shirley-yoo/) at the [Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University](https://peabody.jhu.edu/).

Beyond classical, I have enjoyed producing music for short films, such as the following:

<div style="position: relative; display: block; max-width: 720px; background-color: #000;">
  <div style="padding-bottom: calc(100% / (16 / 9)); position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
    <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/344706294" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 0;" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

Also, I have had a wonderful time composing and playing live with my friends from [Banderlogs](https://www.instagram.com/bndrlgs/). Check out our live session!
