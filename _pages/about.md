Hello! I’m Pedro. I recently finished my MSc in Mathematical and Computational Engineering on the field of Signal Processing from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Today I work as a Research Assistant at the Biomedical Institute of the same university as part of the [iHealth Millenium Institute](https://i-health.cl/en/). My research interests include mathematical optimization, signal processing and data science. In particular, I like building models and algorithms for perceptual-driven spatial sound and biomedical applications. I enjoy how mathematics is in a constant conversation with reality.

#### Spatial Sound with Loudspeakers
In my master thesis I tackled the spatial sound with loudspeakers problem. 


#### Magnetic Resonance Spectroscpy Automated Diagnosis
