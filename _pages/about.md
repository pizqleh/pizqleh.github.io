### About

Hello! I’m Pedro. I recently finished my MSc in Applied Mathematics in Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile on the field of Signal Processing. I like playing around the mathematical foundations of data science, and building models and algorithms for spatial sound and biomedical applications. I enjoy how mathematics is in a constant conversation with reality.


#### Spatial Sound with Loudspeakers
In my master thesis I tackled the spatial sound with loudspeakers problem. 


#### Magnetic Resonance Spectroscpy Automated Diagnosis
